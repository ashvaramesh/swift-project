## Challenges Encountered  

- **UI Scaling Issues**: Some elements did not display properly on smaller screens, requiring layout adjustments.  
- **Navigation Flow**: Users found it difficult to access certain pages efficiently, leading to a refined navigation bar.  
- **Profile Page Responsiveness**: Profile elements were initially misaligned on different screen sizes, but adjustments have improved consistency.
